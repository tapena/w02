Answer the following questions: 

1. What is a strength of Rails (or something you like about Rails)? that they make. I like that they have everything pre-downloaded. We just need to make controllers and models.


2. What is a "controller"? How is it different from a "route"? The controller is the action and the route is the URL


3. Why does `@random` have that `@`? It becomes an instance variable


4. List at least one question you have about Rails. how common is it?
